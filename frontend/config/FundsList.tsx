With borders reopening post-Covid 19, Malaysia is expected to be one of the top performing economies in South East Asia in the coming years", "The tourism industry has passed its trough", "Strong pent up demand was evident through the sharp increase in passenger traffic. With many countries gradually lifting the border restrictions, we expect to see more direct foreign investment coming to Malaysia.", "Investment volume is expected to pick up in 2023", "Price dislocation opportunities will be limited on the back optimism for borders reopening and demand in real estate. The impending rise in construction costs due to current supply constraint will also favour in existing completed real estates as they are ready to tap on the demand spike from the reopening of economic activities.", "Financing environment remains cautious yet accessible", "As the lending climate remains cautious for hospitality assets across the region, important factors to secure sufficient financing include asset quality, upside story and buyerâ€™s profile. With economy activities picking up in 2023, our view is that financial institutions remain keen to participate in the growth trajectory of the real estate industry in Malaysia."],
